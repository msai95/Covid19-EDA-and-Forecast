# Covid19-EDA-and-Forecast
A jupyter notebook detailing the spread of corona virus in 2020 across the world and methods to make future forecasts.

As we all know, Corona Virus is like the uninvited guest that refuses to leave the house. It has wreaked havoc across all forms of life and reminded us humans once again how vulnerable we are. This notebook focuses on visualizing the spread of virus across the world, and was part of my project for a term paper for Social Media Intelligence in my master's degree. This notebook also contains forecasting the number of infections 4 weeks into the future. Enjoy!
